# CT-image-reconstruction
The code implemented the CT reconstruction network described in our peer-reviwed work
"An end-to-end deep network for reconstructing CT images directly from sparse sinograms" submited to IEEE TIP.
The code was written based on  tensorflow2.0.

The sparse matrix AT and inputted sinograms can be donloaded at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kvR9tOnTGVIrx-8Dy-dT6w,
