To demonstrate our network, run testnew.py

To train our model,
run make_ini.py to prepare the training data where the size of input CT images= [L,512,512,1]. 
The sparse matrix AT and input sinograms for test can be downloaded from 
Due to the license limitation, we can not provide the AAPM CT images as  labels. 
After producing the training data, run newmodel.py to begin train the model.
