To test our network, run testnew.py

To train our model,
run make_ini.py to prepare the training data where the size of input CT images= [L,512,512,1]. 

Due to the license limitation, we can not provide the AAPM CT images as  labels. 
After producing the training data, run newmodel.py to begin training the model.
